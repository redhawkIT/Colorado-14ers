## Redux Concepts
- **State** – The state is data that needs to be updated during the life cycle of a component. It contains information on the current state of the component. For example, if you have a switch that is toggled on, you might store something like *switch_value* in the state and then assign it a value of true.

- **Store** – The store is a big JavaScript object that represents the state of the entire app. It is where you save, update, and retrieve the data that needs to be accessible throughout the whole app.

- **Actions** – The specific actions in your app which allow you to update the store. For example, you can have a *SWITCH_ON* action which turns on a  *<Lightbulb/>* component.

- **Reducers** – Reducers specify how the state may change, given a specific action. These accept the data provided by the action and use it to update the store.
